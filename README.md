This repo contains a simple Python script to fetch historical stock data using yfinance, ideal for quant research, trading strategies, and deep learning models for stock prediction.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/quantxaashish/stock-data-fetcher.git
   python stock_data_fetcher.py


This fetches data for NASDAQ (^IXIC), generates plots, and saves a CSV.
Customize the ticker or dates in the code (e.g., change company = 'AAPL').

Example Outputs
<img src="close_prices_plot.png" alt="Historical Close Prices">
<img src="log_transformed_plot.png" alt="Log-Transformed Close Prices">
<img src="differenced_series_plot.png" alt="Differenced Series">
Download sample data: historical_close_prices.csv
Why This Matters
These transformations (log, sqrt, differencing) are key for preparing stock data in deep learning models for predictionâ€”part of my research in AI for finance.
